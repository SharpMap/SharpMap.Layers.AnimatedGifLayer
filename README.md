### SharpMap.Layers.AnimatedGifLayer
The `AnimatedGifLayer` is for puntal data only. It helps to visualize points of high interest.   
The number of features in the layer should be limited, otherwise the visualization will cease and the map won't behave properly.  
The standard animated gif is ![A green dot](https://github.com/SharpMap/SharpMap.Layers.AnimatedGifLayer/blob/master/src/GreenDot.gif) (a green dot).
